In this project we are tasked with building the frontend, backend and database of a website designed by a UX team mate.

Both the front and backends need to be in containers, linked and connected to the database which is a MongoDB Atlas cloud database

The project also had Quick Sort implemented, allowing for filters to be placed on the database content at the frontend.

The project frontend and backend were created and containerised in the first week, along with the database being created and connected. In the second week 
we were given the design for the website which was to be completed by the end of the week.
